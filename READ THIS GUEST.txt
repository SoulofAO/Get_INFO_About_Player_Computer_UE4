For all guests:
You can use the plugin anywhere, as long as you notify me. The plugin works for windows for sure. 
Important: you can get the amount of memory, information about the processor and the version of WINDOWS. 
I'm thinking of adding features for video cards to it, as time will be.

And sorry for the garbage in the project :)
